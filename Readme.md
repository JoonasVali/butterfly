> "Chaos is the science of surprises, of the nonlinear and the unpredictable. It teaches us to expect the unexpected. 
> While most traditional science deals with supposedly predictable phenomena like gravity, electricity, or chemical reactions, 
> Chaos Theory deals with nonlinear things that are effectively impossible to predict or control, like turbulence, weather, the stock market, 
> our brain states, and so on. These phenomena are often described by fractal mathematics, which captures the infinite complexity of nature. 
> Many natural objects exhibit fractal properties, including landscapes, clouds, trees, organs, rivers etc, and many of the systems in which we 
> live exhibit complex, chaotic behavior. Recognizing the chaotic, fractal nature of our world can give us new insight, power, and wisdom. 
> For example, by understanding the complex, chaotic dynamics of the atmosphere, a balloon pilot can “steer” a balloon to a desired location. 
> By understanding that our ecosystems, our social systems, and our economic systems are interconnected, 
> we can hope to avoid actions which may end up being detrimental to our long-term well-being."

Butterfly Effect Simulator is a simulation software for visualizing the butterfly effect in predefined physical environment. 

> In chaos theory, the butterfly effect is the sensitive dependence on initial conditions in which a small change in one state of a deterministic nonlinear system can result in large differences in a later state.
- [wiki](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_effect)

The software allows the observer to run a primitive physical environment with a capability to travel in time and create an alternative timeline effectively 
visualizing how small change or alteration in history causes a large difference as the time progresses.
